Reading this article helped me better understand the importance of wireframing, especially when it comes to working in teams. When it comes to web development and software, teamwork is crucial and working with clients is often the case, so it's important everyone involved understands the final product/the vision. By wireframing, we as developers can also better plan out our final product and understand the components that go into it. We can accurately predict how much time will go into making each component.
